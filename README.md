# takeaway 
## cons
1. Unity has a steep learning curve. Somethings which are very simple such as layout and image resizing become very difficult in Unity. Unity is a game engine and not very suitable for app development.
2. The built-in game object and components are basically rubbish with very limited functions. The quality of assets on the asset store varies. Good assets might require you to paid. Also assets might have bugs and poor documentation.

## pros
1. Asset store contain many assets. 
2. Building is easy, as long as you make sure it run on play mode, 90% you can run on other platforms because the game engine is well made to be a wrapper on different platform.
